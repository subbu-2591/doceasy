# Doctor Dashboard Verification Status Fix

## Issue Fixed
The doctor dashboard was not reflecting the updated verification status from the database. Despite the admin approving a doctor's verification request and the database showing `verificationStatus: 'approved'`, the dashboard continued to display the "Profile Verification Pending" message.

## Root Cause
Field name mismatch between backend and frontend:
- **Backend**: Returns `verificationStatus` (camelCase)
- **Frontend**: Was checking for `enrollment_status` (snake_case)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Field Name Consistency
- Updated all references from `enrollment_status` to `verificationStatus` in `DoctorDashboardNew.tsx`
- Ensured the frontend now correctly reads the verification status from the backend response

### 2. Added Refresh Functionality
- Added `RefreshCw` icon to imports
- Added `isRefreshingProfile` state variable
- Added `refreshProfile` function to manually fetch updated profile data
- Added refresh buttons in both approved and pending states

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Added "Check Status" button for pending verification cases
- Added "Refresh" button for approved doctors
- Added proper loading states and toast notifications
- Improved status display with better handling of different verification states

## Code Changes

### Field Name Updates
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
profileData.enrollment_status === "approved"

// After (correct)
profileData.verificationStatus === "approved"
```

### Added Refresh Functionality
```typescript
// New refresh function
const refreshProfile = async () => {
  setIsRefreshingProfile(true);
  // ... fetch updated profile data
  setIsRefreshingProfile(false);
};

// New refresh button
<Button 
  variant="outline" 
  className="text-gray-600 hover:bg-gray-50" 
  onClick={refreshProfile}
  disabled={isRefreshingProfile}
>
  <RefreshCw className={`h-4 w-4 mr-1 ${isRefreshingProfile ? 'animate-spin' : ''}`} />
  Check Status
</Button>
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Start Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd backend && python app.py
   ```

2. **Start Frontend Server**
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Verification Status Display**
   - Login as a doctor with `verificationStatus: 'approved'` in the database
   - Verify that the dashboard shows "Verified Doctor" badge
   - Verify that appointment and patient management buttons are visible
   - Verify that no "Profile Verification Pending" message is shown

4. **Test Refresh Functionality**
   - Click the "Refresh" button (for approved doctors)
   - Verify that profile data is reloaded
   - Check that appropriate toast notifications appear

5. **Test Pending Status**
   - Login as a doctor with `verificationStatus: 'pending'` or `verificationStatus: 'admin_pending'`
   - Verify that "Profile Verification Pending" message is shown
   - Click "Check Status" button to refresh profile data

## Expected Results

### For Approved Doctors
- ✅ "Verified Doctor" badge displayed
- ✅ Appointments and Patients buttons visible
- ✅ Refresh button works correctly
- ✅ No pending verification message

### For Pending Doctors  
- ✅ "Verification Pending" badge displayed
- ✅ "Profile Verification Pending" message shown
- ✅ "Check Status" button available for manual refresh
- ✅ Limited access to dashboard features

## Database Verification Status Values
- `email_pending`: Email verification not completed
- `profile_pending`: Profile not completed after email verification
- `admin_pending`: Profile completed, awaiting admin approval
- `approved`: Admin has approved the doctor
- `rejected`: Admin has rejected the doctor

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/DoctorDashboardNew.tsx`
  - Fixed field name from `enrollment_status` to `verificationStatus`
  - Added refresh functionality
  - Enhanced UI for better user experience
